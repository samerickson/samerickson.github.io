This is my digital garden. The idea here is that these notes will evolve over time. Each note should be atomic, and as small as possible while still being useful. To prevent me from endlessly trying to categorize these notes into [taxonomical](https://www.wordnik.com/words/taxonomical) folders I have just four sub directories.

1.  [🌱 Seeds](seeds.md): Notes that are in their infancy. Not many links and not much for content.
3. [🌴 Trees](trees.md): Notes that have a fair amount of content but not many links yet.
4. [🍍 Fruit](garden/03-Fruit/fruit.md): Notes that have *mostly* complete content and lots of links.
